Given an iTunes XML file, it will output the contents in some format amenable to
the user.

Currently, all it does is take all the song titles and write them to a text 
file.

This is good enough to use it to make something cool at wordle.net, but I'm
hoping to add some more functionality soon, as noted in the comments in the 
itunesparser.rb file.
