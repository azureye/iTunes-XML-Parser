Given an iTunes XML file, it will output the contents in some format amenable to
the user.

In particular, it can list all the song names, all the artists, all the 
composers, all the album names, and all the genre names in a user's library.

The script lists each item as many times as it appears in the iTunes library
(meaning, it does not remove redundancies), which is useful if you want to make 
something cool out of your library at worlde.net ;)

Additionally, you can choose to have it tell you your total "listening time" 
based on the length and play count for each song.
